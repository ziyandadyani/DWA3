Variables are given and must be used to create two objects named leo and sarah. Both the new leo and sarah objects should be logged in the browser console, followed by their respective postal codes.

Variables given:
leoName

leoSurname

leoBalance

leoNumber

leoStreet

leoPostal

sarahName

sarahSurname

sarahBalance

sarahNumber

sarahStreet

sarahPosta

Note that the new objects should have a nested address object that contains all address-specific information, i.e. street name, house number and postal code. Also, note that all values in the object should be reassigned from the variables at the top of the file. The only exception is the new age value that is added to the object. In the latter, we assign a value directly when declaring the object.
